## 1. Concepts

- **Main Branch (`main`)**
  - Always stable.
  - Deployable or correct version.
- **Feature/Step Branches**
  - Separate branch for each step/task.
  - Allows development without affecting `main`.

## 2. Workflow

### Step 1: Create a branch for each step
```bash
git checkout -b step1
````

* Replace `step1` with a descriptive name for your step.

### Step 2: Work and commit in the branch

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Step1 complete"
```

* Make sure all work is tested and correct before moving forward.

### Step 3: Test the branch

* Ensure that everything works as expected.
* Fix any errors in this branch.

### Step 4: Merge into `main` after verification

```bash
git checkout main
git merge step1
```

* Resolve any merge conflicts if they appear.
* `main` remains stable and updated.

### Step 5: Repeat for next steps

```bash
git checkout -b step2
# do work
git commit -m "Step2 complete"
git checkout main
git merge step2
```
